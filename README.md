# Alloy Sustainability Calculator

**AlloySustainability** is a Python package designed to compute and visualize the sustainability impacts of alloys based on their elemental composition. It retrieves key indicators from external data sources (including a file automatically downloaded from GitHub) and produces comprehensive metrics and visualizations.

## Features

- **Compute Indicators**: Given the mass fractions of 18 elements composing an alloy, compute a range of sustainability indicators (e.g., mass price, supply risk, embodied energy, water usage).
- **Embedded Data**: The package includes two CSV files (`gen_RTHEAs_vs_Fe_df.csv`, `gen_HTHEAs_vs_Ni_df.csv`) embedded within the package, providing baseline reference data for comparison.
- **Automatic Data Retrieval**: A third CSV file (`gen_18element_imputed_v202412.csv`) is automatically downloaded from GitHub, ensuring that you always have the latest data.
- **Visualization**: Easily generate comparative plots (e.g., violin plots) to compare the new alloyâ€™s metrics against reference classes such as FCC HEAs, BCC HEAs, Steels, and Ni-based alloys.

## Installation

Install AlloySustainability directly from PyPI:
```
pip install AlloySustainability
```

## Recommended Environment: Google Colab

To ensure the best experience and compatibility, it is highly recommended to use **Google Colab** for running this package. Google Colab provides a preconfigured Python environment with most dependencies pre-installed, and it allows seamless integration with cloud-based data retrieval.

To get started:
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
2. Install the package.
3. Run the example usage code in a Colab notebook.

This ensures minimal configuration and avoids potential environment-related issues.

## Usage: example workflow
```
from AlloySustainability.computations import (
    load_element_indicators,
    load_RTHEAs_vs_Fe_df,
    load_HTHEAs_vs_Ni_df,
    compute_impacts
)
from AlloySustainability.visualization import plot_alloy_comparison
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load data
element_indicators = load_element_indicators()
RTHEAs_Fe_df = load_RTHEAs_vs_Fe_df()
HTHEAs_Ni_df = load_HTHEAs_vs_Ni_df()

# Define the alloy composition
composition_mass = [0, 0.2, 0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0.2, 0, 0, 0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.2]

# Compute sustainability indicators
new_alloy_impacts = compute_impacts(composition_mass, element_indicators)

# Visualize results
fig = plot_alloy_comparison(new_alloy_impacts, RTHEAs_Fe_df, HTHEAs_Ni_df)
plt.show()
```
